This is a sorting visualizer with 3 basic sorting algorithms. I've always wanted to visualize sorting algorithms in action with different sizes and different speed.

At the same time I've tried to add some of my Front End skills with CSS and using JavaScript with the DOM to make it look more beautiful and very responsive.
