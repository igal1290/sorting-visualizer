# Sorting Visualizer

This is a sorting visualizer with 3 basic sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort). I've always wanted to visualize sorting algorithms in action with different sizes and speed.
</br>
At the same time I've tried to add some of my Front End skills with CSS and using JavaScript with the DOM to make it look nicer and very responsive.
</br>
Quick Sort and Merge Sort will be added later once I master those algorithms.
