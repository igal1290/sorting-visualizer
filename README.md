# Sorting Visualizer

</br>
This is a sorting visualizer with 3 basic sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort). I've always wanted to visualize sorting algorithms in action with different sizes and speed.
</br>
I've added some of my Front End skills with CSS and using JavaScript with the DOM to make it look nicer and very responsive.
</br>
The project will be updated soon to make it mobile friendly, plus Quick Sort and Merge Sort will be added later once those algorithms are fully mastered.
